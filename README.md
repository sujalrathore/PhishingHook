# This is Phishing Hook to deltect the phishsing URL 

The Phishing Detection System is a project designed to detect phishing URLs using machine learning. It leverages various machine learning classification models to predict whether a URL is legitimate or phishing. The project also includes a web-based interface for users to interact with the system, featuring a login and signup functionality.

Features

Phishing URL Detection: Predicts the legitimacy of a URL using trained machine learning models.
Machine Learning Models: Employs multiple classification algorithms for accurate predictions.Web Interface: Developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Flask.
User Authentication: Login and signup system implemented with SQL database for secure user management.

Technologies Used

Front-End:
HTML
CSS
JavaScript

Back-End:
Flask (Python)
SQL Database

Machine Learning:Classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc.)

How It Works
Users interact with the system through a web interface.
URLs are submitted for analysis.
Machine learning models process the URL and predict whether it is phishing or legitimate.
Results are displayed to the user.

Installation and Setup

Clone the Repository:
git clone <repository_url>
cd phishing-detection-system

Install Dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Set Up the Database:
Configure the SQL database for user authentication.
Apply necessary migrations if required.

Run the Application:
flask run
Access the application at http://127.0.0.1:5000.

Usage
Sign Up or Log In: Create an account or log in to access the system.
Submit URL: Enter a URL for analysis.
View Results: Receive the prediction result (Phishing or Legitimate).

Machine Learning Details
The system uses several classification algorithms to ensure robust predictions.Features are extracted from URLs, such as length, special characters, and domain properties.Models are trained on a labeled dataset of legitimate and phishing URLs.
